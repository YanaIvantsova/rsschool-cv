## About myself
Embarking on a journey into the realm of programming, I've taken this path due to a relocation to a new country. Despite being a novice in the programming world, my commitment to learning is unwavering.
Prior to my venture into programming, I spent over five years as a practicing doctor, where my daily interactions with a diverse array of over 20 individuals honed my excellent communication skills. This unique blend of academic and professional experiences positions me as someone adaptable, eager to learn, and equipped with effective communication skills.
